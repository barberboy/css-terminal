## CSS Terminal

[CSS Terminal][projecthome] is a bookmarklet that allows you to inject CSS rules directly
into a live web page. It's handy for rapid CSS development, prototyping 
and debugging.

You can read about it, see it in action and install it at the 
[project home page][projecthome].

#### About

The CSS Terminal bookmarklet was written by Ben Barber while working at
[i2rd / Vipa Solutions][vipa]. The code was generously donated to the 
community under the <a href="#license">MIT license</a>.

The terminal source is written in [CoffeeScript][cs] and resulting 
JavaScript is minified using [Google's Closure Compiler][closure]. 
[Docco][docco] is used to generate the documentation from the CoffeeScript
source.

The [source code and project page][projectsource] are hosted on [GitHub][github].
